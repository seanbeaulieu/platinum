Python application that runs either windowed or in the system tray to periodically notify you of selected vocabulary sets using Windows 10 Toasts. Can adjust interval, active groups/sets of vocabulary, and start/stop the notification thread. Built with tkinter, win10toast, Python 3.11.5.

Run main.py to test.

Roadmap:
- Improve thread stop response time
